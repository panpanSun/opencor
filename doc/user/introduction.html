            The development and exchange of mathematical models usually requires several steps:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Write some model ideas on paper;</li>
            <li>Implement these ideas in C++, Fortran, MATLAB, etc.;</li>
            <li>Write and submit a manuscript which describes the model and includes its mathematical formulations;</li>
            <li>The manuscript gets accepted and published; and</li>
            <li>The manuscript is read and the model implemented by one or several people.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            However, each of these steps is subject to human error.

        <p>
            To address the issue above, the group of <a href="http://www.abi.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/peter-hunter">Prof. Peter Hunter</a> (Auckland, New Zealand) has specified a mark-up language, <a href="http://www.cellml.org/">CellML</a>, to support the definition and sharing of mathematical models through an <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a>-based language, and provide a consistent mathematical representation of a model through <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/">MathML</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="http://www.cellml.org/specifications/cellml_1.0">Version 1.0</a> of the CellML specifications were released in August 2001. These specifcations were subsequently refined to support model evolution and re-use, and were released in February 2006 as <a href="http://www.cellml.org/specifications/cellml_1.1">version 1.1</a>. The inherent nature of CellML means that CellML models are independent of the operating system or programming language used by the user, and model equations can be directly generated and published from the CellML code.
        </p>

        <p>
            CellML on its own is of no use to modellers. Since the release of its specifications, we have witnessed the availability of various <a href="http://www.cellml.org/tools">CellML tools</a>. <a href="http://cor.physiol.ox.ac.uk/">COR</a> and <a href="http://www.opencell.org/">OpenCell</a> are two such tools, but their development has now been discontinued. They are being replaced by OpenCOR which can be seen as a merger of these two tools.
