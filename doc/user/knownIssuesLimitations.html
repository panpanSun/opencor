        <p>
            The following issues/limitations have been reported/observed while using OpenCOR on our <a href="supportedPlatforms.html">supported platforms</a>. They may apply to you, or not, depending on the platform you use and your specific circumstances.
        </p>

        <div class="section">
            Windows, Linux and OS X
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>
                By default, OpenCOR uses your system's language for menus, dialog boxes, etc., as long as it is either English or French (please <a href="contactUs.html">contact us</a> if you would like OpenCOR to support another language). If your system uses another language, then OpenCOR will default to English. Otherwise, if you specifically specify English or French, then please be aware that system messages, dialog boxes, etc. will still be displayed in your system's language (assuming it is not one of the languages supported by OpenCOR).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section">
            Windows
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>
                OpenCOR's File Browser plugin may, on some systems, result in OpenCOR being slow to respond at startup. This has nothing to do with OpenCOR, but with Windows or, more precisely, a program which tightly integrates with it. There are <a href="http://www.brighthub.com/computing/windows-platform/articles/86552.aspx">several known causes and solutions</a> to this problem. However, should none of those solutions work for you, you might then have to uninstall the plugin.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section">
            Linux
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>
                If you run Linux as a virtual machine within <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>, then please be aware that there are known issues with 3D support (e.g. see <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/6848">https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/6848</a>). Now, it happens that OpenCOR needs 3D support, so to get it to work in your virtual machine, indirect rendering might have to be used and this can be done either every time you want to run OpenCOR:

                <pre class="prettyprint">$ LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1 ./OpenCOR</pre>

                or once and for all by exporting <code>LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT</code> (e.g. in your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file):

                <pre class="prettyprint">export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1</pre>

                <div>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> to disable 3D hardware acceleration in your virtual machine is not enough.
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
